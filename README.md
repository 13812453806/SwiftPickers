This is a Swift port of [ActionSheetPicker-3.0](https://github.com/skywinder/ActionSheetPicker-3.0/). However, this project contains some functionality which is different from the original component and certain design decisions have been taken to keep things simpler for this version.

The basic functionality of SwiftPicker can be seen in the following animated GIF:

SwiftPicker also contains a button component which allows you to configure your picker and display it on screen easily via the button. The button will display the current selection value as its label.

**Note:** Currently, the code has only been tested on iPhone. The code is supposed to work on iPad as well but I cannot guarantee that it will till I've had a chance to test the iPad functionality :)

Further documentation will be coming in the future once I've managed to add all the picker functionality.
