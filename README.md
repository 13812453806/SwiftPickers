## Overview ##

This is a Swift port of [ActionSheetPicker-3.0](https://github.com/skywinder/ActionSheetPicker-3.0/). However, this project contains some functionality which is different from the original component and certain design decisions have been taken to keep things simpler for this version.

The basic functionality of SwiftPicker can be seen in the following animated GIF:

SwiftPicker also contains a button component which allows you to configure your picker and display it on screen easily via the button. The button will display the current selection value as its label.

Further documentation will be coming in the future once I've managed to add all the picker functionality.

## Installation ##

You can install the `SwiftPicker` components two ways:

### Pickers ###

The picker components are not visual components that can be added via Interface Builder. Instead, you have to create them via code.

### Button Pickers ###

The button picker components can be added to your application two different ways:

#### Via Interface Builder ####

#### Via Code ####
